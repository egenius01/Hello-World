# Hello-World
Aii, my name is Emmanuel Omoragbon, i am a student of the university of benin, i am also a data scientist that uses python to analyse, clean and visualize data.I also am a machine learning coder, if thats what i can call it, i'm not an expert yet but im in the Process yh.

I am currently learning to use React Js for great UI/UX's, its part of my journey to becoming a full stack developer. i already use bootstrap, html, css but spicing it all up with React js is a big Advantage.
